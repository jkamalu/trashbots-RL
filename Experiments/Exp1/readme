This experiment shows that 3 agents are able to find the 3 trash sources and are even more capable of splitting the work. We can see that after a while each agent sticks to one trash source.

For John:
reward picture explaination: the curve shows the average reward of each agent over the complete time. So at step 10000 it shows (sum of reward steps 1 to 10000)/10000. This can not exceed 1 in the long run as currently the return to collect smth. is 10 and trash gets generated by probability 1/10. Therefore if all agents get 1 this is optimal.
