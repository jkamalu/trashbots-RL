This experiment is a basic test whether our agents are able to learn and how they solve a basic environment. To test this we set up a first environment of a 10x10 grid with three trash sources located at the coordinates (1,6),(6,7),(2,7) and run three agents in that environment. Theoretically the agents should be able to split up and focus on one trash source each such that all trash can be collected
