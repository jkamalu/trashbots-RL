This experiments evaluates the effect of the number of agents put in an environment with 3 trash sources. We evaluate the combined performance as the average of the summed reward for all agents. This number can in the long run not exceed three as there are three trash sources. In the graph we can see that two agents are already able to collect all the trash of three trash sources. They can achieve this by oscillating between the trash sources. Another observation is a faster mastery of the environment with more agents. This is quite natural as more agents are more likely to discover the trash sources during their random walks.
